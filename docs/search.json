This is Evelyn, Zihan Zhu.\nI’m a PhD student in Government and Politics at the University of Maryland, College Park with a primary field in International Relations and a secondary field in Comparative Politics.\nPrior to beginning doctoral studies, I was awarded Honors Bachelor of Arts by the University of Toronto, St. George’s in June 2019, and received Master of Social Sciences from the University of Macau in June 2023.\nI currently study the following mega theme: the politics of aid. Specifically, I look at how states’ foreign policy agenda shape their aid policy, how middle powers leverage on their rotating leadership in prominent IOs to induce foreign policy alignment via aid disbursement, and how successful such policies have been. I have a country-specific focus on Japan due to its uniqueness among democracies. I also take some interest in electoral politics (e.g., political dynasties), and the emerging trend of global authoritarianism. I have been working as Research Assistant to faculty on projects broadly defined in the field of International Relations.\nAs a political scientist in an early career stage, I tend to keep things open. I’m also gradually building my CV and other relevant materials.\nBeyond my professional profile, I’m a dog person and a J-pop fan."

    "text": "Zhu, Z. 2025. “Reconfiguring Hierarchies: Japan’s Pursuit of Networked Security Framework in a Contested Indo-Pacific.” SAIS Europe Journal of Global Affairs 28(1): 78-96.\n\nSummary: This paper examines Japan’s evolving security strategy under Prime Minister Abe’s second premiership, situating it within broader structural transformations in East Asia’s regional order. Anchored in the hedging school of neorealist thought, the analysis traces how Japan’s strategic posture has shifted in response to perceived limitations within the U.S.-led “hub-and-spoke” alliance system. Conceptualizing this moment as a critical juncture, the paper argues that Japan’s recalibration toward a networked security framework—manifested through the Free and Open Indo-Pacific (FOIP) vision and the revitalization of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad)—constitutes a deliberate effort to complement bilateral alliances with inter-spoke and minilateral cooperation."
