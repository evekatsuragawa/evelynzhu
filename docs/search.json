    "text": "Welcome! This is Evelyn, Zihan Zhu.\nI’m a PhD student in Government and Politics at the University of Maryland, College Park with a primary field in International Relations and a secondary field in Comparative Politics.\nPrior to beginning doctoral studies, I was awarded Honors Bachelor of Arts by the University of Toronto, St. George’s in June 2019, and received Master of Social Sciences from the University of Macau in June 2023.\nI currently study the interaction between domestic political institutions & actors and foreign policy decision-making (particularly regarding international trade) with a country-specific focus on Japan due to its uniqueness among democracies. I also take some interest in electoral politics (specifically political dynasties), and the emerging trend of global authoritarianism. I have been working as a research assistant to Prof. Todd Allee on projects that broadly cover international trade and international institutions.\nAs a political scientist in an early career stage, I tend to keep things open for furture research. I’m also gradually building my CV and other relevant materials.\nBeyond my professional profile, I’m a dog person and a J-pop fan."
